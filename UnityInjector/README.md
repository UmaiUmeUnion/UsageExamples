# UnityInjector usage examples

Most of the examples are written following the PHP (Patcher-Hook-Plugin) architecture and naming convention.

List of available examples:

| Example name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `HelloWorld` | "Hello, world!" tutorial for UnityInjector. Contains the bare-bones structure of a plugin. Shows how to use `SafeConsole` class and logging. |
| `ExSimpleExIniConfig` | Shows how to use the `Preferences` property and ExIni to load simple configuration files. |

Each project folder contains the patcher projects, external projects and a README with a basic description and a list of required assemblies.

Every source-code file in the example is documented and commented.
